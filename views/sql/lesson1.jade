	p The first lesson in SQL Injection series	

	p.
		A successful injection attack can bypass the appâ€™s access control and gain access. 
		Here we have a simple login form to demonstrate this.

	p.
		There is a user named John Doe in the database, whose password is password.

	p.
		You can try loggin in with that to see the normal behavior. 

	p.
		Next, you should try to get an error message as a result. This will tell you that this form is vulnerable 
		to SQL Injection.

	p.
		All you need to do next is construct a well devised password to login as root.

	a(href="#", onclick="showHint()") hint  
	div#hint(style="display:none; ") 
		p The password should be formated as 
		span(style="color:red")' or 1=1#
		p
		p Explanation:
		img(src="/images/sql_1.png", width="500px");

	script.
		function showHint(){
			$('#hint').show();
		}
